# 🐎 UmaMusume Training Assistant - Python Utilities

Welcome to the **UmaMusume Training Assistant**, a collection of Python-based tools designed to help you make smarter decisions while training your horse girls (Uma Musume) for victory!

This repository contains small but powerful scripts that analyze and simulate training results based on input stats, assisting you in winning races more consistently by understanding character growth mechanics.

---

## 💡 Purpose

In Uma Musume: Pretty Derby, training effectively is key to success. This project provides support tools to:

- **Analyze training stat gains** based on input type (e.g., Speed, Stamina).
- **Understand how growth percentages** influence overall stat development.
- **Compare character-specific growth stats**, such as **McQueen** and **Scarlet**, for strategic planning.

Whether you're aiming to win URA Finals or become a Legend Trainer, this repo helps you maximize every training session.

## 📁 Features So Far

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `mcqueen_training_calc.ipynb` | Calculates McQueen's stat distribution from a given **Stamina** input. |
| `scarlet_training_calc.ipynb` | Calculates Daiwa Scarlet's stat distribution from a given **Speed** input. |
| Future Scripts (Coming Soon!) | Training planner, race strategy recommender, stat curve visualizer, and more! |

## 🧠 How It Works

Each script follows these steps:

1. **Ask user input** for the base stat they want to simulate.
2. **Apply character-specific growth rates** based on that stat.
3. **Calculate derived stats** (Speed, Stamina, Power, Guts, Wit).
4. **Display results** in clean, sorted format for quick decision-making.

## 🏇 Characters Covered

### 🍚 Tokai Teio, Mejiro McQueen, Daiwa Scarlet...
Each character has different growth focus. Currently supported:
- **McQueen**: Focuses on **Stamina**, suited for long-distance races.
- **Scarlet**: Focuses on **Speed**, great for mid-short range races.

Custom calculation rules are used based on their stat distributions and training patterns.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

Only Python 3 required! No external libraries needed unless expanded later.

```bash
python mcqueen_training_calc.ipynb
python scarlet_training_calc.ipynb
````

Or open them in **Jupyter Notebook** for easier interaction.

## 🎯 Goal of the Project

This repository is not just a calculator. It's a **toolbox for competitive Uma Musume players** who want to dominate events, climb ranks, and deeply understand stat mechanics.

By automating stat distribution and highlighting character-specific logic, we reduce guesswork and optimize performance!
